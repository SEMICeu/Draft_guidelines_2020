To solve the closed and open world mismatch, the proposal is made to separate the different concerns into different files:

* An RDFS file (required) with human-oriented semantics containing labels, definitions, scope and usage note that will serve two other models

* One (optional) in RDFS/OWL, aimed at inferring new facts

* One in SHACL (required) that defines the classes with their attributes and relationships, and the constraints on occurrences and values used

The focus of this section is on providing guidelines for core source RDFS files with human-oriented semantics (see Figure 1 below).

The subsections below are a breakdown of the RDFS file and contain detailed related guidelines.

* link:{base-wiki-dir}vocabulary[Vocabulary]: the guidelines for vocabularies such as declaring the namespaces, appropriately importing the other vocabularies and adding metadata in an RDFS file
