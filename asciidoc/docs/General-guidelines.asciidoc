UML diagrams should serve for human comprehension; therefore, they should be as readable as possible, i.e. their pragmatic quality should be ensured footnote:[Lindland, Odd & Sindre, Guttorm & Sølvberg, Arne. (1994). Understanding Quality in Conceptual Modelling. IEEE Software. 11. 42-49]. 

To this end, below is an indication of high-level guidelines for UML diagrams footnote:[The Elements of UML 2.0 style, Scott W. Ambler, Cambridge University Press, 2005].

ifdef::backend-pdf[**Guideline {counter:guideline-number}: Crossing lines**::]
{nbsp} **Summary**::
When lines cross, the diagram may be potentially misread. Hence, crossing lines SHOULD be avoided.

{nbsp} **Description** ::
The reader of the diagrams needs to have a clear understanding of the diagram content. If the diagram is well organised, and if associations between classes are well separated and run in parallel – i.e. lines never cross or the least possible – the diagram will gain clarity and will become less error-prone.

Straight lines are more comfortable to follow, therefore diagonal or curved lines SHOULD be avoided.

Lines SHOULD have sufficient spacing in between them.

Text is easier to read in a horizontal fashion, labels SHOULD thus be aligned horizontally.

Symbols SHOULD be of the same size (unless one wants to draw attention to a specific element), as nothing should draw more attention unless aimed.

{nbsp} **Summary**::
In Europe, people generally read left to right and top to bottom, hence diagrams SHOULD be organised left to right and top to bottom.

{nbsp} **Description** ::
The reader of the diagrams needs to have a clear understanding of the diagram content. If the diagram is not well organised and the associations between classes are not clear, the diagram becomes more error-prone.

ifdef::backend-pdf[**Guideline {counter:guideline-number}: Short and concise**::]
{nbsp} **Summary**::
Too many details may diminish readability and understandability, thus diagrams SHOULD contain only the necessary level of detail.

{nbsp} **Description** ::
If the diagram offers the reader too much detailed information, it can overburden them and hinder their understanding of the diagram elements.

{nbsp} **Summary**::
More specialised symbols have the danger of not being broadly understood, therefore only well-known notations SHOULD be used.

{nbsp} **Description** ::
If symbols are used that are too specific for the reader to understand the diagram's content could be improperly conveyed the potentially less knowledgeable readers.

Larger diagrams can be difficult to read, thus they CAN be split into multiple smaller ones.

The reader of the diagram needs to have a clear understanding of the diagram's content. If the diagram lines are too long to be comfortably followed the diagram will become more error-prone.

{nbsp} **Summary**::
As they are more comfortable to read, one-page diagrams SHOULD be used when possible.

{nbsp} **Description** ::
The reader of the diagrams needs to have a clear understanding of the diagram's content. If the diagram is divided into many small versions, the reading effort is higher, becoming more error-prone.

ifdef::backend-pdf[**Guideline {counter:guideline-number}: Element metadata**::]
{nbsp} **Summary**::
Each UML element SHALL be annotated with the following metadata: +
 * there SHALL be one rdfs:label containing the human-oriented label in English; +
 * there CAN be more rdfs:label but only one per language; +
 * there SHALL be one rdfs:comment in English (1..1) containing the concept’s intention, being the definition of the element (the class, the attribute, the association); +
 * skos:altLabel (0..n) CAN be used to indicate synonyms; +
 * skos:scopeNote in English (0..1) CAN be used to clarify how, where and when to use the UML element.

{nbsp} **Description** ::
To ensure a minimum content richness, certain metadata should be added to the UML elements.
