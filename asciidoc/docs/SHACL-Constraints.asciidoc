To solve the closed and open world mismatch, the proposal is made to separate the various concerns into different files:

* An RDFS file (required) with human-oriented semantics containing labels, definitions, scope and usage note that will serve two other models
* One (optional) in RDFS/OWL, aimed at inferring new facts
* One in SHACL (required) that defines the classes with their attributes and relationships, and the constraints on occurrences and values used

The focus of this section is to provide guidelines for object-oriented shapes at the level of eGovernment Core Vocabularies (see Figure below).
