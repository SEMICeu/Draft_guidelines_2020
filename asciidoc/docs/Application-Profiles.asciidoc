Commonly an application profile focuses on defining constraints and should be covered with SHACL (see Figure 1 below). However, an additional RDFS/OWL file could be needed in two cases:

. If the application profile wants to introduce additional classes and properties not available in the eGovernment Core Vocabulary or other application profile one is deriving from

. If additional semantic constructs are needed for generating further derivations or inferences

Such an application profile follows the same rules as eGovernment Core Vocabularie; therefore, the identical guidelines apply:

* link:{base-wiki-dir}vocabulary-semantics-in-rdfs-owl[eGovernment Core Vocabularies semantics in RDFS/OWL]
